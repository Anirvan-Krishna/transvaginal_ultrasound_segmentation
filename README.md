# Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge: Self-supervised Segmentation of Cervical Ultrasound Images
This work is done as a part of the course EE61008: Medical Image Analysis, a part of the curriculum of Signal Processing and Machine Learning Specialization at Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. The problem statement is based off the Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge from the International Symposium of Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025). 

**Challenge Objectives:** To develop an algorithm that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cervical image segmentation in transvaginal ultrasound images.
