# Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge: Self-supervised Segmentation of Cervical Ultrasound Images
This work is done as a part of the course EE61008: Medical Image Analysis, a part of the curriculum of Signal Processing and Machine Learning Specialization at Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. The problem statement is based off the Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge from the International Symposium of Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025). 

**Challenge Objectives:** To develop an algorithm that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cervical image segmentation in transvaginal ultrasound images. 

**Data Description:** Transvaginal ultrasounds of the uterine cervix were recorded after bladder emptying. Women were positioned in a low Fowler's position during the scan. Women were asked to empty their bladder immediately before the examination. Images were taken using a curved transducer with a frequency range from a 2 to 10-MHz vaginal probe (used for cervical US screening in second trimester patients). Operators were instructed to avoid using any type of post-processing or artifacts such as smoothing, noise, pointers or calipers when possible. The remaining image settings parameters such as gain, frequency and gain compensation were left to their discretion. These images include cervix anatomical structures (the anterior lip and posterior lip of the cervix).
